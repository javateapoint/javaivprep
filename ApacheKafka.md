# Advantages of Using Kafka in Event-Driven Microservices

Apache Kafka has become a cornerstone in building modern distributed systems, especially in event-driven microservices architectures. This document explores the advantages of using Kafka, details real-world use cases, and provides end-to-end code examples to help you understand its benefits in a production setting.



## Introduction

Event-driven microservices architectures use events as the primary mode of communication among distributed services. Kafka acts as a fault-tolerant, horizontally scalable, and durable message broker, allowing microservices to communicate asynchronously through a publish/subscribe model.

By decoupling producers and consumers, Kafka enables services to scale independently, handle high-throughput data streams, and perform complex stream processing. The combination of these features makes it ideal for real-time analytics, log aggregation, and system integration scenarios.

---

## Key Advantages of Kafka

1. **Scalability**  
   *Kafka supports horizontal scaling very well.*  
   Zonal or global events can be partitioned and spread across multiple brokers, allowing your system to scale seamlessly as the volume of events increases.

2. **Reliability and Durability**  
   *Kafka persists data to disk and replicates it within the cluster.*  
   This ensures that messages are not lost in case of broker failures. With configurable retention policies, Kafka can serve both real-time processing and long-term data storage needs.

3. **High Throughput and Low Latency**  
   *Kafka's distributed commit log design enables processing of millions of messages per second with minimal latency.*  
   This is crucial for event-driven architectures where speed and immediate response to events is imperative.

4. **Loose Coupling Between Services**  
   *Kafka enables asynchronous communication between services.*  
   Producers and consumers are decoupled, meaning services can evolve independently. This modular design improves maintainability and simplifies scaling each component.

5. **Fault Tolerance and High Availability**  
   *With its replication and partitioning features, Kafka is highly resilient.*  
   It automatically handles node failures without service interruption, ensuring high availability of event streams.

6. **Stream Processing Capabilities**  
   *Kafka Streams and KSQL provide powerful real-time stream processing features.*  
   You can transform, aggregate, and join streams of data with ease, enabling complex analytics tasks in real time.

7. **Replayability**  
   *Kafkaâ€™s persistent log allows consumers to replay events.*  
   This makes it easy to recover from errors, test new features, or reprocess data as business requirements change.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Financial Transactions Processing**  
   Financial institutions use Kafka to handle millions of transactions per second, ensuring that each transaction is reliably processed, audited, and stored for compliance.

2. **E-Commerce Order Management**  
   When an order is placed, multiple microservices (inventory, payment, shipping, notification) can independently subscribe to order events. Kafka ensures that even if one service is temporarily down, the messages persist and will eventually be processed.

3. **IoT Data Aggregation**  
   Companies deploy Kafka to collect and process sensor data from thousands of IoT devices in real time. This data can be used for monitoring, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance.

4. **Log Aggregation and Analytics**  
   Kafka collects logs and events from multiple services, which can then be streamed into analytics systems for centralized monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting.

5. **Real-Time Recommendations and Personalization**  
   Streaming data from user interactions is processed in real time to generate dynamic recommendations on e-commerce or content platforms.

import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MessageProducer {

    private static final String TOPIC = "events_topic";

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    public void sendMessage(String message) {

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/kafka")
public class MessageController {

    @Autowired
    private MessageProducer producer;

    @PostMapping("/publish")
    public String publishMessage(@RequestParam("message") String message) {
        producer.sendMessage(message);

    }
}


```


```java
// MessageConsumer.java
package com.example.kafka.listener;

import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MessageConsumer {

    @KafkaListener(topics = "events_topic", groupId = "event-group")
    public void listen(String message) {
        System.out.println("Consumed message: " + message);
    }
}


```

### Explanation
* Producer:  The MessageProducer uses KafkaTemplate to send messages to the events_topic. This imitates a microservice event publisher.

* Consumer: The MessageConsumer listens to messages on the same topic using @KafkaListener. It processes (prints out) the consumed messages, simulating event-driven behavior among microservices.

* Controller: The MessageController exposes a REST endpoint to trigger the production of events, illustrating how external calls can initiate event-driven workflows.







# Real-Time Example: Improved Kafka Consumer with Concurrency and Batch Processing

# Improving Kafka Consumer Performance Under Increased Load

When an increased load from the publisher causes more messages to be sent to Kafka, the consumer must keep pace to avoid backlogs. In an interview scenario, you'll be asked how to make Kafka consumers fast enough to handle this load. This document outlines various strategies, configuration tweaks, and code examples to optimize consumer performance.

---

## Strategies to Accelerate Kafka Consumption

### 1. **Increase Consumer Parallelism**

- **Partitioning & Consumer Groups:**  
  The more partitions you have in a topic, the more consumers you can effectively run in parallel within one consumer group. Ensure that the topicâ€™s partition count aligns with your desired parallelism.  
  *Best Practice:* If the load increases, scale out your consumer instances (or threads) by increasing the number of consumers in the group.

- **Concurrency in Spring Kafka:**  
  Use Spring Kafkaâ€™s built-in support for concurrent listeners by setting the concurrency level on your `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory`.  
  *Example:*  
  ```java
  @Bean
  public ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, String> kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
      ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, String> factory =
              new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
      factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
      factory.setConcurrency(4); // Increase this number as needed.
      return factory;
  }
  ```

# What Happens When You Call `factory.setConcurrency(4)`

In Spring Kafka, the `setConcurrency(int concurrency)` method on the `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory` configures how many concurrent Kafka consumer threads will be created for a given listener container. Hereâ€™s what it entails:

1. **Multiple Listener Containers:**  
   Setting concurrency to 4 instructs Spring to create 4 separate `KafkaMessageListenerContainer` instances for that listener. Each container runs on its own thread.

2. **Parallel Processing:**  
   With 4 consumer instances, you can process messages concurrently. If your topic has at least 4 partitions, each consumer instance will be assigned one partition from which to fetch messages in parallel.

3. **Increased Throughput:**  
   By handling multiple partitions concurrently, the overall message consumption rate can increase significantly. This helps in situations where the publisher's load is high.

4. **Partition to Consumer Mapping:**  
   - Each consumer instance within the listener container is responsible for consuming messages from one or more partitions.
   - If the number of partitions is less than the concurrency level, some consumer instances may remain idle.

5. **Thread Management:**  
   The concurrency setting determines the number of threads that are used for polling Kafka. More threads allow for greater parallelism but also require sufficient CPU and memory resources.

## Example Scenario

Assume you have a topic with 4 partitions.  
- With `setConcurrency(4)`, each of the 4 consumer instances will get one partition, and all partitions will be processed in parallel.
- If you increase the number of partitions to 8 and keep concurrency at 4, each consumer instance might process 2 partitions concurrently.

## Summary

Using `factory.setConcurrency(4)` is a way to increase the parallelism of your Kafka consumer within a consumer group:
- It allows messages to be processed faster by creating multiple consumer threads.
- It is especially useful when dealing with high-volume data streams.
- Always ensure that the topicâ€™s partition count is aligned with the configured concurrency for optimal performance.

This setting is one of several tuning parameters that can be adjusted to meet the performance requirements of your event-driven microservices.



# Impact of `setConcurrency(4)` with 3 Pods in EKS

When you configure your Kafka consumer using Spring Kafka with `factory.setConcurrency(4)` in each pod and use 3 pods in your EKS cluster, the following happens:

1. **Multiple Consumer Threads per Pod**  
   Each pod will create 4 consumer threads (or listener containers). This means that within one pod, there are 4 threads handling message consumption concurrently.

2. **Total Consumers in the Consumer Group**  
   Since you have 3 pods running, the total number of consumer instances in the consumer group becomes:
   

#### Total Consumers = Number of Pods x Concurrency per Pod = 3 x 4 = 12 Consumers


These 12 consumer instances are all part of the same consumer group if configured with the same group ID.

3. **Partition Assignment**  
Kafkaâ€™s consumer group protocol will distribute topic partitions among these 12 consumer instances:
- If the topic being consumed has **12 or more partitions**, each consumer thread can be assigned one or more partitions.  
- If the topic has **fewer than 12 partitions**, only as many consumers as there are partitions will actively receive messages. The remaining consumer threads will be idle (i.e., they wonâ€™t be assigned any partitions).

4. **High Availability and Load Distribution**  
Running multiple pods with concurrency helps in both higher throughput and fault tolerance:
- **High Throughput:** With 12 consumer threads, you can process messages at a higher rate.
- **Fault Tolerance:** If one pod fails, the remaining pods will still provide 8 consumer threads (2 pods x 4) to continue processing, thereby ensuring high availability. Kafka will rebalance the consumers, and partitions from the failed pod will be reassigned to the remaining consumers.

5. **Real-World Implications**  
- **Scalability:** The design allows you to scale horizontally by increasing the number of pods, each contributing additional consumer threads.
- **Resource Utilization:** Ensure that the total number of partitions in your Kafka topics is adequate to fully utilize the consumer threads. If the topic has a significantly lower partition count than the total consumers, some consumers will remain idle.
- **Operational Considerations:** Monitor and adjust concurrency and partition counts to meet your processing requirements and to avoid over-provisioning consumer threads that might not be fully utilized.

## Summary

- **Configuration:** `setConcurrency(4)` in each pod.
- **Pods Running:** 3 pods in EKS.
- **Total Consumer Instances:** 12 consumers (3 pods Ã— 4 per pod).
- **Partition Handling:** The actual active consumer threads will depend on the available partitions. If there are fewer partitions than consumers, some threads will be idle.
- **Fault Tolerance:** If one pod fails, Kafka rebalances and the remaining consumers (8 in this case) continue processing the available partitions.

This setup ensures increased parallel processing capacity across the consumer group, while also providing a level of redundancy and high availability in a distributed environment like EKS.

# Understanding Kafka Consumer Groups

## What Is a Consumer Group?

A **consumer group** in Apache Kafka is a set of consumer instances that share the same `group.id`. Within a consumer group:

- **Load Balancing:** Every record published to a Kafka topic is processed by **only one consumer** within the group. This means that the work of processing messages is distributed (or load-balanced) among all members of the group.
- **Parallel Processing:** The group enables parallel processing because Kafka will assign different partitions of a topic to different consumers. Each partition is the unit of parallelism.
- **Fault Tolerance:** If a consumer instance fails or is removed, Kafka automatically reassigns its partitions among the remaining consumers, ensuring that message processing continues without interruption.

## What Problems Do Consumer Groups Solve?

Consumer groups tackle several challenges in distributed messaging systems:

1. **Scalability:**  
   By allowing you to add more consumer instances (across multiple machines or pods), consumer groups enable horizontal scaling. If one consumer cannot handle the message load, more consumers in the same group can be added to process messages in parallel.

2. **Load Balancing:**  
   Since Kafka assigns each partition of a topic to only one consumer in a group, the workload is evenly distributed. This ensures that one consumer is not overwhelmed while others remain idle.

3. **Fault Tolerance & High Availability:**  
   With consumer groups, if one consumer dies, Kafka will rebalance the partitions and assign them to other active consumers in the group. This minimizes downtime and maintains continuous message processing.

4. **Parallel Processing of Streams:**  
   By partitioning a topic and distributing partitions across consumers, consumer groups support efficient parallel processing, which is essential for high-throughput and low-latency applications.

## Real-Time Use Cases in Microservice Architecture

### Use Case 1: Order Processing in E-Commerce

Imagine an e-commerce platform where several microservices handle different aspects of an order:

- **Payment Service:** Processes payments.
- **Inventory Service:** Manages stock levels.
- **Notification Service:** Sends notifications to customers.

When an order is placed, an event such as `OrderPlaced` is published to a Kafka topic (e.g., `orders-topic`).  

- **Scenario:**  
  The `Notification Service` subscribes to `orders-topic` with a consumer group named `order-notifications`.  
  - Topic: `orders-topic` has 6 partitions  
  - Consumers in `order-notifications` group: 3 consumers  
  - **Outcome:** Each consumer on average will be assigned 2 partitions (if the partition allocation is balanced).  
  - **Benefit:** If one consumer fails, the other two will take over the processing of messages from the failed consumerâ€™s partitions.

### Use Case 2: Real-Time Analytics

A microservice architecture might include a logging or real-time analytics service that aggregates logs from various services:

- **Scenario:**  
  Logs are published by multiple microservices into a topic called `logs-topic`.  
  - Topic: `logs-topic` has 8 partitions  
  - Consumers in the analytics service group: 4 consumers  
  - **Outcome:** Each consumer is responsible for 2 partitions, allowing for parallel processing of logs and faster analysis.
  - **Fault Tolerance:** If a processing node crashes, Kafka redistributes the 2 partitions the node was processing among the remaining consumers, ensuring that no logs vanish.

### Use Case 3: IoT Data Processing

Consider a network of IoT devices that send telemetry data to a centralized processing service:

- **Scenario:**  
  A topic `iot-data-topic` is used to stream sensor data.  
  - Topic: `iot-data-topic` has 10 partitions  
  - Consumer group (`iot-processors`): 5 consumers  
  - **Outcome:** Each consumer will get 2 partitions, and the high throughput of IoT data is handled in parallel, ensuring timely processing.
  - **Scaling:** If more sensor data is expected, the consumer group size can be increased, provided that there are enough partitions to allocate to new consumers.

## Numerical Example Scenario

Consider a Kafka topic with **4 partitions**:
- **Scenario A:**  
  - Consumer Group A has **2 consumers**.
  - **Result:**  
    - Each consumer might be assigned 2 partitions.
    - Increased parallel processing with even load distribution.
  
- **Scenario B:**  
  - Consumer Group A has **5 consumers**.
  - **Result:**  
    - Since partitions (4) are fewer than consumers (5), 4 consumers will actively process one partition each, and 1 consumer will be idle.
    - This illustrates why the number of partitions should ideally be equal to or greater than the number of consumers in a group to maximize parallelism.

## Summary

- **What is a Consumer Group?**  
  A set of consumers sharing the same `group.id` that enables load balancing and fault tolerance by ensuring that each message in a topic partition is processed by only one consumer of the group.

- **Problems Solved:**  
  Scalability, fault tolerance, load balancing, parallel processing.

- **Real-Time Use Cases:**  
  - E-commerce order processing (e.g., 6 partitions, 3 consumers)
  - Real-time analytics (e.g., 8 partitions, 4 consumers)
  - IoT data processing (e.g., 10 partitions, 5 consumers)

Consumer groups are fundamental in Kafka deployments and are key to building resilient, scalable, event-driven microservice architectures.

### 2. Tune Consumer Configuration
* max.poll.records: Increase max.poll.records to allow the consumer to fetch larger batches of messages per poll. This reduces the overhead of frequent polling. 
Example:
 ```java
props.put(ConsumerConfig.MAX_POLL_RECORDS_CONFIG, 500);

```

* fetch.min.bytes and fetch.max.wait.ms: Adjust these properties to ensure the consumer fetches ample data in one poll while not waiting too long.
Example:

```java
props.put(ConsumerConfig.FETCH_MIN_BYTES_CONFIG, 1*1024);  // e.g., 1KB
props.put(ConsumerConfig.FETCH_MAX_WAIT_MS_CONFIG, 100);     // e.g., 100ms wait time

```
* session.timeout.ms and max.poll.interval.ms: These settings should be tuned to allow longer processing time if needed, preventing unnecessary rebalances.

### 3. Optimize Message Processing Logic

* Offload Long-Running Tasks: If message processing is resource-intensive, offload the heavy work to asynchronous executors or separate services. The Kafka listener thread should remain light and avoid blocking calls that delay subsequent polls.

* Asynchronous Processing: Process batches concurrently by using a thread pool. For example, within your listener, dispatch processing tasks to an executor service.

Example:

```java
@Autowired
private ExecutorService executorService;

@KafkaListener(topics = "events_topic", groupId = "event-group")
public void listen(List<String> messages) {
    // Submit each message for parallel processing:
    messages.forEach(message ->
        executorService.submit(() -> processMessage(message))
    );
}


```

# Kafka Partitions, Consumers, and Consumer Groups: Best Practices and Scenarios

Apache Kafka's design revolves around the interplay between topics (partitioned into multiple parts), consumer groups, and individual consumers. Understanding the optimal relationship among these elements is critical for achieving high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable messaging architectures.

## Key Concepts Recap

- **Partition:**  
  A partition is the basic unit of parallelism in Kafka. Data for a topic is split into partitions that can be stored across multiple brokers.

- **Consumer:**  
  A consumer is an application instance that receives messages from one or more partitions.

- **Consumer Group:**  
  A consumer group is a collection of consumers (all using the same `group.id`) that collectively subscribe to one or more topics. Kafka assigns partitions to consumers so that each partition is consumed by only one consumer within the group.

## Best Practices for Partition and Consumer Relationships

1. **Parallelism and Throughput**
   - **Rule:** For maximum parallelism, the number of partitions should be equal to or greater than the total number of consumers within a consumer group.
   - **Scenario:**  
     - **Example:** If you have a topic with 10 partitions and a consumer group with 10 consumers, ideally each consumer gets assigned one partition. This configuration maximizes parallelism.
     - **Tip:** If your workload increases, you can scale by increasing the partition count (and ensuring your brokers support this), then add more consumers accordingly.

2. **When Partition Count Is More Than Consumers**
   - **Outcome:** Several partitions will be assigned to each active consumer.
   - **Scenario Example:**  
     - **Example:** A topic has 8 partitions, but the consumer group only has 4 consumers.  
       - Each consumer might receive 2 partitions.
     - **Implication:**  
       - While parallelism is reduced relative to the maximum available partitions, this configuration is effective if processing these partitions concurrently can be handled by a single consumer instance.
       - **Best Practice:** Avoid having too many partitions per consumer if each partition's data volume is high, or consider increasing the number of consumers if feasible.

3. **When Consumer Count Exceeds Partition Count**
   - **Outcome:** Some consumers will remain idle because Kafka assigns one partition per consumer within the same consumer group.
   - **Scenario Example:**  
     - **Example:** A topic with 4 partitions and a consumer group with 6 consumers.
       - Only 4 consumers will be active (each handling one partition), and 2 consumers will be idle.
     - **Implication:**  
       - This is inefficient since you're over-provisioned with consumer instances.
       - **Best Practice:** Design your system so that consumer count does not consistently exceed the partition count, unless you plan to adjust the topicâ€™s partitions in the future when scaling. If using Kubernetes or cloud auto-scaling, ensure that the number of pods/consumers is aligned with the number of partitions.

4. **Consumer Group Rebalancing**
   - **Overview:**  
     - When consumers join or leave a consumer group, Kafka reassigns partitions among active consumers.
     - **Best Practice:**  
       - Plan for rebalancing events by ensuring that your consumer processing logic can handle partition reassignments gracefully.
       - Avoid long processing times per record to minimize the chance of triggering rebalances.

5. **Optimal Partitioning Strategy**
   - **Initial Planning:**  
     - Estimate your expected data throughput and processing parallelism.
     - Choose a number of partitions that allows future scaling without excessive rebalancing.
   - **Future Scaling:**  
     - While you can increase partition counts later, it may affect ordering guarantees. Plan partitions with a view toward iterative scaling.
   - **Numerical Guideline:**  
     - For a high-traffic topic, start with a partition count that is at least 1.5-2Ã— the anticipated maximum number of consumer instances in a consumer group over a given scaling window.

## Scenario-Based Examples

### Scenario 1: Balanced Load for E-commerce Orders

- **Use Case:** A microservice processes orders in an e-commerce system.
- **Configuration Example:**  
  - **Topic:** `order-events`
  - **Partitions:** 6 partitions (to allow parallel processing)
  - **Consumer Group:** `order-processor`
  - **Consumers:** 6 consumers for maximum parallelism.
- **Outcome:**  
  - Each consumer handles one partition.  
  - If one consumer fails, Kafka rebalances, and remaining consumers take over the failed consumer's partition(s), albeit with increased load until scaling is restored.

### Scenario 2: Over-provisioned Consumers in Real-Time Analytics

- **Use Case:** A logging/analytics service subscribing to application logs.
- **Configuration Example:**  
  - **Topic:** `app-logs`
  - **Partitions:** 4 partitions
  - **Consumer Group:** `log-analyzer`
  - **Consumers:** 6 consumers deployed across high-availability pods.
- **Outcome:**  
  - Only 4 consumers receive messages; the other 2 remain idle.
  - **Best Practice:**  
    - Either reduce consumers or increase partitions if scaling logs processing is needed.

### Scenario 3: Adjusting for IoT Data Ingestion

- **Use Case:** Processing streaming data from IoT devices.
- **Configuration Example:**  
  - **Topic:** `iot-data`
  - **Partitions:** 10 partitions (anticipating high volume and need for parallel processing)
  - **Consumer Group:** `iot-processors`
  - **Consumers:** 5 consumers.
- **Outcome:**  
  - Each consumer is assigned 2 partitions.
  - This setup provides balanced parallelization, and if increased load is expected, additional consumers can be added later up to 10, aligning with the number of partitions.

## Summary Table

| **Scenario**                      | **Partitions** | **Consumers** | **Comment**                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Balanced Processing               | 6              | 6             | Each consumer gets 1 partition for maximum parallelism.                                     |
| More Partitions Than Consumers    | 8              | 4             | Each consumer gets 2 partitions; increased load per consumer but still effective.             |
| More Consumers Than Partitions    | 4              | 6             | Only 4 consumers will be active; 2 are idleâ€”over-provisioning leads to resource waste.         |
| High-Volume IoT Data Processing   | 10             | 5             | Each consumer processes 2 partitions; scaling can be done by adding up to 10 consumers.         |

## Conclusion

- **Consumer Group:** Ensures the work (i.e., partitions) is fairly distributed among a set of consumers.
- **Parallelism:** Achieved by aligning partition counts with consumer counts.
- **Scalability & Fault Tolerance:** Consumer groups provide resilience by rebalancing partition assignments during changes in consumer membership.
- **Optimization Strategy:** Design partition counts based on expected throughput and desired parallelism. Avoid over-provisioning consumers relative to the partition count, while ensuring enough consumers to handle the processing load.

These guidelines help in designing a robust Kafka-based event-driven system where throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability are in balance.

# Scaling Kafka Consumers: Same Group vs. New Consumer Group

When the load increases in your Kafka-based system, the typical solution for scaling consumption is **to add new consumers to the existing consumer group** rather than creating a new consumer group. Hereâ€™s why:

## Why Add New Consumers to the Same Consumer Group?

1. **Load Distribution Through Partition Assignment:**  
   In Kafka, a consumer group ensures that each partition is assigned to exactly one consumer instance in the group. When you add a new consumer to the same group:
   - **Rebalancing Occurs:** Kafka automatically rebalances the topic partitions across all consumers in the group.
   - **Increased Parallelism:** The additional consumer means that more partitions can be processed concurrently, boosting throughput.

2. **Avoiding Duplicate Processing:**  
   If you create a new consumer group, Kafka treats it as an independent subscriber. This means that every message published will be delivered to each consumer group. In many scenarios, this is not desired because:
   - **Duplication of Work:** Messages will be processed twiceâ€”once by the consumers in the original group and once by those in the new group.
   - **Offset Management Complexity:** Each consumer group maintains its own offset pointers. Managing multiple groups for the purpose of scaling can lead to increased complexity and potential inconsistencies.

3. **Simplicity & Consistency:**  
   Using the same consumer group:
   - **Centralized Management:** Consumers work together to process messages without overlapping their work.
   - **Easy Rebalancing:** Scaling is straightforwardâ€”add more consumer instances to your orchestration environment (e.g., Kubernetes pods) and let Kafka rebalance the partitions.

## When Would You Create a New Consumer Group?

Creating a new consumer group is appropriate if you want to implement multi-tenant processing or have distinct processing pipelines for the same data. For instance:
- **Different Business Requirements:** One consumer group might process events for real-time analytics while another might store them for long-term archiving.
- **Independent Processing Pipelines:** When two separate teams require different views or processing logic on the same stream of data.

However, if your goal is strictly to scale out processing due to an increased load, **extending the same consumer group** is the appropriate strategy.

## Numerical Example

Imagine you have a Kafka topic with 10 partitions:

- **Scenario A (Correct Scaling):**  
  - **Existing Setup:** 5 consumers in the group â†’ Each consumer handles 2 partitions.
  - **Load Increases:** Add 2 more consumers to the same group â†’ Total of 7 consumers.
  - **Result:** Partitions are rebalanced among 7 consumers (for example, some consumers may handle 1 partition while others handle 2), increasing overall parallel processing capability.

- **Scenario B (Wrong Scaling Approach):**  
  - Instead of adding consumers to the current group, a new group is created with 2 additional consumers.
  - **Result:**  
    - The original group (with 5 consumers) continues processing the 10 partitions.
    - The new group (with 2 consumers) also processes all 10 partitions independently.
    - **Outcome:** Messages are effectively processed twice; one set by each consumer group. This is useful for duplication scenarios but not for scaling a single logical flow.

## Summary

- **For Increased Load and Throughput:**  
  Add new consumers to the _existing consumer group_. This leverages Kafkaâ€™s partition allocation to distribute work among more instances, increasing processing capacity without duplicating work.

- **For Independent Processing Pipelines or Multi-Tenancy:**  
  Use separate consumer groups if different processing requirements are needed.

In most scalability cases where the goal is to speed up processing due to increased load, **adding consumers to the same group** is the best strategy.

This approach ensures that your Kafka consumers scale effectively by taking full advantage of Kafkaâ€™s built-in consumer group rebalancing mechanism.
