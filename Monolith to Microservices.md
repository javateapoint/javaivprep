# Migrating an Online Bookstore Monolith to Microservices

---

## 1. Pick a Real-Time Example

Consider an online bookstore that runs as a single Spring Boot application handling user registration, catalog, cart, order processing, payment, and shipping.

---

## 2. Assess the Monolith

Review the code structure, database tables, performance bottlenecks, and team pain points.

Key factors to note:

- Modules that change most often  
- Performance or scalability bottlenecks  
- Areas blocking independent deployments  

---

## 3. Define Domains with Domain-Driven Design

Break the business into logical areas:

- Customer Management (accounts, profiles)  
- Catalog (books, search, categories)  
- Cart & Checkout (shopping cart, order creation)  
- Payment (processing and refunds)  
- Shipping (label creation, tracking)  

Each area becomes a bounded context with its own data model and ubiquitous language.

---

## 4. Map Out Microservice Boundaries

Decide on service boundaries by business capability and data ownership.

| Microservice     | Responsibility                            | Database      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Customer Service | User signup, login, profile updates       | customers_db  |
| Catalog Service  | Book listing, search, inventory levels    | catalog_db    |
| Order Service    | Cart management, order validation         | orders_db     |
| Payment Service  | Charging cards, refund management         | payments_db   |
| Shipping Service | Label creation, tracking updates          | shipping_db   |

---

## 5. Plan Data Strategy

Options for migrating data:

- Strangler Fig Pattern: route new requests to microservices while legacy code handles old paths  
- Dual Write: have both monolith and microservice write to the new database until cut-over  
- Change Data Capture: stream DB changes with tools like Debezium into new service stores  

Aim for one database per service to enforce boundaries and avoid tight coupling.

---

## 6. Define Service Contracts & Communication

**Synchronous flows** (e.g., checkout → payment):  
- REST with versioned endpoints or gRPC for high throughput  

**Asynchronous flows** (e.g., order placed → shipping triggered):  
- Publish events to Kafka or RabbitMQ  
- Services subscribe to topics for loose coupling and resilience  

| Pattern            | When to Use                | Trade-Offs                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| REST               | Immediate request/response | Easy but can create tight coupling      |
| gRPC               | High-performance, polyglot | Fast but adds setup complexity          |
| Event Streaming    | Decoupled workflows        | Resilient but eventual consistency      |

---

## 7. Build & Deploy Microservices

Use Spring Boot best practices:

- Spring Cloud Config for centralized settings  
- Spring Boot Actuator for health checks and metrics  
- Resilience4j for circuit breakers and retries  

Containerize each service with Docker and deploy via Kubernetes or AWS ECS.  
Automate builds and deployments through a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions → Docker Registry → Kubernetes).

---

## 8. Implement Observability

Set up centralized logging, distributed tracing, and metrics dashboards:

- ELK/EFK stack for logs  
- OpenTelemetry + Jaeger for tracing  
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics  

Instrument each service so you can trace a user’s entire journey.

---

## 9. Secure and Govern

Apply zero-trust principles:

- API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway) for authentication, rate limiting, routing  
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect for identity management  
- mTLS via a service mesh (Istio or Linkerd) to encrypt inter-service calls  

---

## 10. Testing and Cut-over Strategy

Adopt a testing pyramid:

- Unit tests per service  
- Contract tests (Pact) between services  
- End-to-end tests in staging  

Migrate traffic gradually using feature flags or canary releases.  
Monitor error rates and rollback if needed.
