# Serializable vs. Externalizable in Java

Java provides two interfaces to support object serialization: `Serializable` and `Externalizable`. Knowing the differences between these two is important for designing classes that need to be converted into a byte stream and later reconstructed.

## Overview

- **Serializable:**  
  - A marker interface (it contains no methods) that tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to use its default mechanism to serialize the object.  
  - It uses reflection to automatically save and restore the objectâ€™s state.  
  - Customization is possible through the implementation of private methods like `writeObject()` and `readObject()`.  
  - It does not require the class to define a public no-argument constructor.
  
- **Externalizable:**  
  - Extends `Serializable` but requires the implementation of two methods: `writeExternal(ObjectOutput out)` and `readExternal(ObjectInput in)`.  
  - Gives the programmer full control over the serialization process.  
  - Requires the class to have a public no-argument constructor to facilitate instantiation during deserialization.  
  - Can lead to improved performance if optimized correctly, but increases the burden on the developer to handle all aspects of the serialization process manually.

## Comparison Table

| **Feature**              | **Serializable**                                                     | **Externalizable**                                                     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interface Type**       | Marker interface (no methods)                                        | Extends `Serializable`; mandates implementation of `writeExternal` and `readExternal` |
| **Default Behavior**     | JVM uses reflection to serialize the entire object automatically     | Programmer manually handles the serialization logic                    |
| **Customization**        | Limited customization via `writeObject()`/`readObject()` methods       | Full customization; explicit control over which fields to serialize      |
| **Performance**          | May incur overhead due to reflection, especially for large object graphs | Can be more efficient if optimized, though it requires extra coding effort |
| **Constructor Requirement** | No public no-arg constructor needed (object creation bypasses constructors) | Requires a public no-arg constructor for deserialization                  |
| **Versioning and Maintenance** | Uses `serialVersionUID` to control compatibility; changes to class structure can lead to issues if not managed properly | Developer is responsible for handling class versioning and structure changes manually |
| **Ease of Implementation** | Straightforward, as it requires minimal implementation effort          | More complex due to necessity to write custom serialization and deserialization logic |

## Detailed Explanation

### Serializable

Implementing `Serializable` is as simple as declaring that your class implements this marker interface:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Person implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    // Constructors, getters, setters, etc.
}


```
The JVM automatically serializes the fields of the Person class. If certain fields should be skipped (for example, for security or performance reasons), you can mark them as transient. Custom behavior can also be added by defining private methods: private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream oos) and private void readObject(ObjectInputStream ois).

Serializable is simple to use since it abstracts much of the serialization details away from the developer. However, it may not offer the best performance when you need fine-grained control over which state is persisted or when working under strict performance constraints




## Externalizable
When you implement the Externalizable interface, you take direct control over the serialization process:

```java

import java.io.Externalizable;
import java.io.ObjectOutput;
import java.io.ObjectInput;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Person implements Externalizable {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    // Mandatory public no-arg constructor
    public Person() {
    }
    
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException {
        // Customize: Only serialize the desired fields
        out.writeUTF(name);
        out.writeInt(age);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        // Customize: Read fields in the same order as written
        name = in.readUTF();
        age = in.readInt();
    }
}
```

### With Externalizable, you gain complete control over what gets saved and restored. This is particularly useful if:

- You want to exclude certain fields from serialization.

- You want to change the default serialization format to optimize performance.

- You need to maintain backward compatibility by manually handling changes in class structure.

- The extra control, however, comes with added complexity, as any modifications to the class structure must be managed in both the writeExternal and readExternal methods. This approach is more error-prone and demands careful maintenance, especially when the class evolves over time 3.

## When to Use Which
### Use Serializable if:

- You want a simple and straightforward way to serialize objects.

- You are okay with the default serialization provided by the JVM.

- You do not require extensive customization of the serialization process.

### Use Externalizable if:

- You require complete control over the serialization process for performance or security reasons.

- You want to serialize only parts of the object or apply a custom serialization format.

- You are prepared to manage compatibility and versioning manually.
